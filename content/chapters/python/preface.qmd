# Preface {#sec-preface}

These lecture notes are inspired by the many books and resources I have used in this course. "Learning Python the Hard Way" and "How to Think Like a Computer Scientist" have inspired my own notes on programming. These implement the following ideas, which I think best support learning in an introduction to programming:

1. Each topic and concept is introduced so that it can be applied immediately on top of what you know.
2. The introduction of each topic covers only the most basic facts and rules required to learn the rest through practical exercises.

I would like to improve these notes as much as I can. If you find errors in exercises, poorly explained concepts, redundant information, missing items, or exercises that would work better in a different order, please let me know. You can do this by [reporting an issue](https://github.com/munch-group/bioinformatics/issues).

Happy coding,<br>
