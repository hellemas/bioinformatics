# Your kind of thing {#sec-classes}

*Do you know what type you are? Python objects do, and this chapter is about how they know.*

## What defines the type of an object? {.unnumbered}

By now, you know that Python values are objects and that there are different *types* of objects. Strings have the type `str,` integers have the type `int`, and lists have the type `list,` to mention a few of the ones we know. Remember that you can use the built-in `type` function to find out what type an object is. Try this:

```python
print( type('banana') )
print( type(4) )
print( type([]) )
```

As you already know, objects are "data with associated functionality." Some of this functionality is available as methods: for example, the `upper` and `split` methods of string objects or the `append` and `extend` methods of lists. 

Objects also behave sensibly in different contexts: When if you sum two integers (`4 + 6`), you get their sum `6`, but if you sum two strings (`'ban' + 'ana'`), you get a concatenation of the two strings `'banana'`. The two different types of objects each know how to act with the `+` operator. Another example is iteration: If you iterate over a string, you get one character at a time in order, but if you iterate over a dictionary, you get the keys in the dictionary (in random order). This super convenient context-aware behavior is, in fact, also defined as methods, but more about that below.

Each object carries its own data: different numbers, different stings, etc., but their *functionality* is shared by all objects of the same type. So all string objects refer to the same definition of the `upper` and `split` methods in the string *type* as graphically illustrated in figure @fig-objects_and_type.

## Making your own objects {.unnumbered}

Imagine creating your own types of objects carrying a particular kind of data and functionality. "Data" can be anything. In bioinformatics, it could be an open reading frame, a patient profile, or a tree. Fortunately, Python lets us do this using something called *classes*. Classes define new kinds of objects and the functionality they provide. So, by defining a new class, you define a new type of object, and the methods you define in that class are available to objects of the type that particular kind (type). 

Let's define a new class, `Point,` that represents a point in a two-dimensional coordinate system. As shown in @fig-points, each such point has an x-value and a y-value, so we need our new point object to hold two numbers representing those values.

Here is how we define the `Point` class:

```python
class Point:

    def __init__(self, x, y):
        self.x = x
        self.y = y
```

Let us break it down: We use the keyword `class` followed by the name of the class we define. Nested under that statement, we can put a
